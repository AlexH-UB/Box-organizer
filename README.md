## Box-organizer

---

### Basic idea:

Lots of reaction tubes are generated nn biological laboratories and it is easy to lose the overview of your DNA/RNA probes even with the provided numbering. Often tubes are not labeled properly and you find yourself in a situation where you have multiple tubes labeled with just numbers from 1 to 10. To encounter this problem I am writing a program that helps you organizing your tubes into virtual boxes that correspond to your freezer/fridge boxes in real life. This should help you keep the order of your boxes.

### Basic functions:

* Save Probes with associated information into different boxes
* Search Probes with name or entry information
* Calender function to keep track of your probes in time
* Link differnt probes to each other

---

### Todo:

* Update code according to PEP20 guidelines

### Installation:

Install required python libraries:

```python
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:

```python
# python GUI.py
```

# Box-organizer

In biological laboratories a lot of reaction tubes are generated and it is easy to lose an overview of your probes even with the provided numbering. Often tubes are not labeled properly and you find yourself in a situation where you have multiple tubes labeled with just numbers from 1 to 10. To encounter this problem i write a program that helps you organizing your tubes into virtual boxes that correspond to your freezer/fridge boxes. This should help you keep the order of your boxes.
